              positions at the time of one's birth. Pandit Ji, an expert astrologer, interprets this chart to reveal
              insights into an individual's personality, relationships, career, and life path. The chart encompasses 12
              houses, each representing specific aspects of life. Pandit Ji analyzes key elements such as the Ascendant,
              planetary positions, zodiac signs, and dasha periods to offer guidance on auspicious timings, potential
              challenges, and suitable life choices. The Janam Kundali serves as a valuable tool for self-discovery and
